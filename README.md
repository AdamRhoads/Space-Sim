This is just an orbit sim I made. I was bored and it was summer.


Controls:

  General:
    Switch Body Type: Space
    Place Body: Left Click anywhere on the screen
    
  Velocity:
    Add Forward Velocity: W
    Add Backward Velocity: S
    
  Rotation:
    Rotate Counterclockwise: A
    Rotate Clockwise: D


How it works:

          m1 * m2
F = G *  ---------
            r^2

(and just make G = 1, so all of the numbers are nice since 6.673X10^(-11) N m^2 / kg^2 is not the prettiest)
